          We are thrilled you want to start your career in health care
          at HCC Coleman College
        </p>

        <p>
          However, unlike other HCC colleges, enrolling at HCC Coleman is a
          competitive and selective process. Some programs require successful
          completion of courses before you are allowed to apply for admission.
          Not all programs admit all the applicants they receive. Additionally,
          some programs accept one class per year, while others admit two.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can see there are a lot of details involved in choosing the best
          program for you. That's why we want to get to know you better and ask
          you to visit our campus in person prior to applying for admission.
        </p>

        <p>
          But there is on common element to every student's application: you
          must be a Houston Community College student at the time you apply
          for admission to an HCC Coleman College health science program. Find
          the application to HCC at
          <a href="http://hccs.edu/application" target='_blank'>hccs.edu/application</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once you have completed the HCC application, or if you already have
          an HCC student identification number, visit
          <a href="http://coleman.hccs.edu" target='_blank'>coleman.hccs.edu</a>
          to begin your health science application process. If you have
          questions, contact us at
          <a href="mailto:studentsfirst@hccs.edu">studentsfirst@hccs.edu</a>
          or chat online with an HCC Coleman representative at
          <a href="http://coleman.hccs.edu/AskColeman">askColeman</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Welcome to the first step in your health care career. HCC Coleman
