              </div>
              <p>
                A nurse touches everyone's life at least once. Maybe a nurse
                first handed you to your mother in the delivery room or
                helped you and your family understand a difficult medical
                problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                Or perhaps a nurse even saved your life or the life of a loved
                one. Nurses are legendary figures in our society. No matter
                where they work - in the frenzy of a trauma center or a quiet
                patient floor - they efficiently and precisely perform every
                hour, every day. Consistency, compassion and critical thinking
                are just three elements of a nurse's multi-faceted career.

              <p>
                Patient care services are a vital aspect of any health
                institution. These individuals are responsible for much of the
                hands-on care that occurs in a hospital, doctor's office or
                clinic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tasks may include, but are not limited to, greeting patients
                as they enter and leave the doctor's office, assist surgeons
                in the operating arena and provide information to the patient
                as well as their families. They also monitor the mental,
                physical and emotional needs of the patient.
              </p>
              <p>
                The men and
                women who make up the Patient Care Services team are your best
                friends in a time of vulnerability. With them by your side,
                you will never walk alone.

              <p>
                The professions that make up the Therapeutic Services Pathway
                have dedicated themselves to helping people who have suffered
                debilitating injuries or who have undergone major surgery.
              </p>
              <p>
                Walking to the refrigerator or tying shoelaces are activities
                that most people take for granted. But for a person
                recovering from major surgery or who has suffered a stroke,
                these activities may not be so basic anymore.
              </p>
              <p>
                Therapeutic services professionals specialize in helping people
                regain a sense of normalcy to their lives. Without their
                expertise, having another chance at life would be impossible.

                When a physician needs answers to what is ailing his or her
                patient, they turn to the Diagnostic Services team. This group
                of highly advanced technicians manipulates and tests body
                fluids or tissues in search of what is causing a patient's
                illness.
              </p>
              <p>
                They are technologists who utilize specialized
                machines that use radiation and sound waves to produce images
                that doctors can use to diagnose anything from a broken bone
                to cancer.
              </p>
              <p>
                The professions that make up the Diagnostic Services
                pathway are crucial in the health care industry because they
                set the foundations for a patient's trust.

                The programs that make up the Health Care and Administrative
                pathway vary widely in what they do on a day-to-day basis, but
                each program has one major goal in common: enhance the quality
                of life for those they serve.
              </p>
              <p>
                They help patients who suffer from chemical dependency, prepare
                and package life-saving medications and organize data used to
                track patient treatments and medical billing.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a patient needs information about their medications,
                assistance understanding their medical records or help
                overcoming an addiction, the members of the Health Care and
                Administrative team can help guide them to the answers they need.

                The two programs that encompass the Dental Services pathway are
                in-demand fields, crucial in maintaining the resilience of a
                smile.

              <p>
                Nervous about a check-up? Dental Assistants will gear you up for
                necessary treatments as they prepare the instruments needed
                for the procedure and even walk you through along the way.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dental Hygienists help patients maintain good oral health and
                educate them on how to care for their teeth and protect their
                oral cavity from diseases.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dental Assistants and Dental Hygienists help patients see oral
