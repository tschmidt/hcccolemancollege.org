          Finding your place in the health care industry can be a little like picking the right cereal in the supermarket: There are just too many choices. Some people know exactly what they want; others need a little guidance. If you’re looking for direction discovering your fit in health care, the HCC Health Care Career Academy is here for you. HCCA gives students the opportunity to learn about the many various fields of health care. It’s the perfect opportunity for anyone ready to start a career in an exciting, compassionate industry.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The HCCA is offered at convenient locations throughout the HCC District:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>HCC Southeast College, Eastside Campus</li>
          <li>HCC Southwest College, West Loop Center</li>
          <li>HCC Central College, Willie Lee Gay Campus</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          You’ll take one semester of full-time classroom instruction (two semesters if part-time) followed by a clinical internship with an organization in the world-renowned Texas Medical Center®. The internship will provide you with hands-on practice in an health care setting and allow you to obtain a marketable skills award at completion - an essential component if you are interested in finding a job.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Each student takes three core classes and an elective, which will determine the clinical experience you have during the second semester. You may choose between Phlebotomy (the art and science of drawing blood for processing) or Sterile Processing (the specific procedures to clean and sterilize surgical instruments for use in operating rooms).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Most importantly, the HCCA offers each student a personalized career plan that discovers your strengths and directs you toward careers that reach your full potential. The clinical internship offers the best opportunity for an employer to hire you permanently following graduation. And don’t forget, most HCC students qualify for financial aid to help with the cost of tuition, books, and fees.
